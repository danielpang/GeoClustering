# Geo Clustering
Map multiple street addresses onto a Google maps page as points of reference.

Motivation for this project came from being able to locate clusters of customers on a map 
and the density of each cluster. Then from the data visualization target each highly populated
cluster with digital advertising through longitude and latitude positions and with a radius.
